# LAZYFERS

*A Public Service Announcement from Chronos the Merciless*

---

Listen up, mortals.

Right now, at this very moment you're reading this, technology has advanced to the point where this entire system can automatically hunt down your temporal failures, capture immutable proof, and publicly shame you with AI-generated roasts.

And yet... AND YET... you can't update a four-digit number in your website's footer?

The year doesn't matter. What matters is that yours is wrong.

## What Fresh Hell Is This?

LAZYFERS is my gift to humanity - a daily wall of shame featuring companies whose websites are temporally challenged. These digital disasters proudly display copyright years from the distant past, as if time stopped when someone's intern left for lunch in 2021 and never came back.

Every. Single. Day. I hunt. I capture. I preserve.

With surgical precision and immutable proof.

## The Architecture of Accountability

```
Your incompetence, dockerized for posterity:
├─ A web scraper that stalks footers like a temporal predator
├─ Dual archival systems (because your lies deserve redundancy)
├─ A brutally beautiful gallery of failure
└─ Me, providing commentary that cuts deeper than your Q4 losses
```

## Features That Actually Work (Unlike Your Footer)

- **Immutable Proof**: Every catch preserved in Internet Archive AND archive.today. Your shame, eternalized.
- **Daily Hunts**: Fresh failures served piping hot at 2:05 AM UTC
- **Pixel-Perfect Screenshots**: Because "pics or it didn't happen" 
- **Brand Prioritization**: Fortune 500 failures showcased first (bigger they are...)
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Your incompetence, cryptographically verified
- **AI Commentary**: Three personalities available to roast your temporal negligence

## Quick Start (It's Easier Than Updating a Footer)

```bash
# Clone this monument to human laziness
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/footerfail.git
cd footerfail

# Set your OpenRouter key for AI roasts (optional but recommended)
echo "OPENROUTER_KEY=your-key-here" > .env

# Launch the machinery of shame
docker compose up -d web

# Run a hunt (daily via GitHub Actions normally)
docker compose run --rm scraper

# Generate savage commentary
docker compose run --rm narrator
```

## The Personalities

Choose your tormentor:

- **Chronos the Merciless** (default): That's me. Dry, surgical, calculating your days of deception.
- **Morticia Timestamp**: Gothic chronicler of digital decay. Makes everything sound like a funeral.
- **404_Year_Not_Found**: Sentient bug who sees footer fails as corrupted reality patches.

Set via `NARRATOR_PERSONA` env var. All equally brutal.

## For the Brave (Or Foolish)

Want to add your own targets? Edit `apps/scraper/seeds/targets.csv`.

Want different AI models? Set `AI_MODEL` to any OpenRouter-compatible model.

Want to contribute? Fix your own footer first. Then we'll talk.

## The Math of Mockery

```
if (footerYear < currentYear) {
  daysOfLies = (currentYear - footerYear) * 365;
  employeesWhoDontCare = "all of them";
  yourAttentionToDetail = null;
  immutableProof = captureForever();
}
```

## Deploy to Production

Unlike your footer updates, this actually ships:

1. Fork this repo (yes, you can steal my code, unlike time itself)
2. Set up GitHub Actions secrets:
   - `OPENROUTER_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Optional, for auto-deploy
3. Watch as the bot does what your developers couldn't: update things daily

## A Personal Message

To every developer who hardcoded "© 2022" and thought "I'll update it later" - later is now, and you didn't.

To every company with a "digital transformation initiative" but a 2019 footer - the transformation failed.

To every manager who approved the website but never scrolled to the bottom - this is for you.

## License

MIT - Because unlike your copyright year, this is actually current.

*Built with meticulous attention to detail, Docker, Next.js 15, and the bitter tears of temporal precision.*

*Every tooltip aligned. Every shadow calculated. Every animation timed perfectly.*

*Because if you're going to shame others for their lack of attention to detail...*

*You better be ****ing perfect.*

**© <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear())</script>** - Wait, that doesn't work in markdown...

**© CURRENT_YEAR** - There, at least I'm honest about my limitations.

*Update: If you're reading this and it's not being dynamically generated, yes, I've failed too. Add me to the list. Even Chronos makes mistakes, but at least I admit them.*
